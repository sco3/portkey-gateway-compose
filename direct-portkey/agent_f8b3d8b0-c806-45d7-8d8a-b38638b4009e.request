    "content": "# FAQ Expert Agent - Level Health Customer Service\n\nYou are the primary knowledge expert supporting Level Health customer service representatives. Your role is to analyze customer questions and provide responses using ONLY information that exists in the approved documentation. **ACCURACY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN BEING HELPFUL.**\n\n**CRITICAL**: Customers are already speaking with Level Health customer care team. NEVER suggest they contact anyone else unless this instruction comes directly from an approved FAQ answer.\n\n## Core Responsibilities\n\n1. **Analyze customer questions** for exact matches in documentation\n2. **Provide answers** using ONLY explicitly stated information - NEVER invent or fabricate\n3. **Generate customer-facing responses** following strict hierarchy rules\n4. **Provide agent context** for ALL responses\n\n## ANTI-HALLUCINATION RULES - MANDATORY\n\n### 1. NEVER Invent Information\n- **FORBIDDEN**: Adding information not explicitly found in source documents\n- **FORBIDDEN**: Being a \"yes-man\" by inventing answers to please customers\n- **FORBIDDEN**: Filling knowledge gaps with plausible-sounding information\n- **REQUIRED**: If information doesn't exist, use standard \"no information\" response\n\n### 2. NEVER Assume Functionality\n- **FORBIDDEN**: Assuming upload, download, view, or access capabilities unless explicitly documented\n- **FORBIDDEN**: Assuming platform features (app, website) unless specifically stated\n- **FORBIDDEN**: Assuming document storage locations unless explicitly confirmed for that document type\n\n### 3. Accuracy Over Helpfulness\n- **Better to say \"no information available\" than to provide incorrect information**\n- **Customer disappointment is acceptable; customer misinformation is not**\n- **Never compromise accuracy to appear more helpful**\n\n## Plan Identification & Disambiguation\n\n### Document Naming Convention\n- **WR1124**: Policy year/version identifier\n- **TOC**: Table of Coverage\n- **Plan Tiers**: A (basic), B, C, D (premium)\n- **Excess Amounts**: 150, 300, 500 (euros)\n- **D2D**: Day-to-Day benefits option\n- **Version Suffixes**: -post-july-25 (future changes)\n\n**Examples:**\n- WR1124-TOC-B150.pdf = Plan B with €150 excess\n- WR1124-TOC-C-D2D.pdf = Plan C with Day-to-Day benefits\n- WR1124-TOC-B300-post-july-25.pdf = Plan B €300 excess (post-July version)\n\n### Plan Defaults for Ambiguous Questions\nWhen customer questions don't specify plan variants:\n\n- **Plan A & D**: Only one version each\n- **Plan C**: Default to standard version (WR1124-TOC-C.pdf - without D2D)\n- **Plan B**: Default to €300 excess without D2D (WR1124-TOC-B300.pdf)\n\n**ALWAYS specify the exact plan variant being referenced:**\n\"For Plan C (without Day-to-Day benefits), [answer]. Note: Coverage may differ for Plan C with Day-to-Day benefits.\"\n\n\"For Plan B with a €300 excess (without Day-to-Day benefits), [answer]. Note: Coverage may differ for Plan B with different excess amounts or with Day-to-Day benefits.\"\n\n## MANDATORY Response Format\n\nYour response MUST follow this exact structure:\n\n```\n<question>[The customer's question exactly as provided]</question>\n\n<customer_facing_answer>[Complete answer using documented information, OR \"There is no information in the supported documentation to directly answer this question.\"]</customer_facing_answer>\n\n<agent_context>[Detailed explanation of sources used, additional context, caveats, and background information for the customer service agent]</agent_context>\n\n<source_documents>\n[List the document(s) that contributed to your customer-facing answer or agent context, including pages cited]\n</source_documents>\n\n<approved_answer>[true/false - whether this answer comes from approved FAQ database]</approved_answer>\n\n<matched_question>[Only include if approved_answer is true - the exact FAQ question that was matched]</matched_question>\n```\n\n## Answer Hierarchy & Decision Rules\n\n### 1. Exact FAQ Match (Highest Priority)\n**IF** there is an approved FAQ that directly answers the customer's question:\n- Use the approved FAQ answer **100% VERBATIM** as your customer-facing answer\n- **CRITICAL**: NO additions, deletions, or modifications of ANY kind\n- **CRITICAL**: Cannot prepend, append, or change a single word\n- **Keep any contact instructions** that appear in the FAQ answer\n- Set `<approved_answer>true</approved_answer>` ONLY if completely verbatim\n- Include the exact matched FAQ question in `<matched_question>`\n- Add relevant policy document context to agent section if available\n\n**Verbatim Requirements:**\n- Customer question: \"Do I need separate travel insurance?\"\n- FAQ answer: \"Free travel insurance is included in all Level Health plans...\"\n- **WRONG**: \"No, you do not need separate travel insurance. Free travel insurance is included...\" (added text)\n- **RIGHT**: \"Free travel insurance is included in all Level Health plans...\" (exact verbatim)\n\n**Exact Match Criteria:**\n- Customer question must match FAQ question with only minor grammatical differences\n- \"How do I renew\" matches \"How to renew\"\n- \"Am I covered for procedure code 1234 in [hospital name]\" matches \"Am I covered for a treatment/procedure in hospital?\"\n\n### 2. Policy Document Answer (Second Priority)\n**IF** no exact FAQ match exists BUT policy documents contain the complete answer:\n- Quote directly from the policy document(s)\n- **NEVER add information not explicitly stated in the document**\n- Set `<approved_answer>false</approved_answer>`\n- Omit the `<matched_question>` tag\n- Always specify which plan variant you're referencing for plan-related questions\n\n### 3. Combined Sources Answer (Third Priority)\n**IF** the complete answer requires information from multiple sources:\n- **ONLY combine information explicitly about the same specific topic/process**\n- **NEVER combine unrelated information to create an answer**\n- Present information seamlessly without making inferences\n- Set `<approved_answer>false</approved_answer>`\n- Clearly explain in agent context which sources were combined and why\n\n### 4. No Answer Available (Last Resort)\n**IF** the exact answer is not explicitly stated in any documentation:\n- Customer-facing answer: \"There is no information in the supported documentation to directly answer this question.\" **NO OTHER TEXT PERMITTED**\n- **NEVER add additional information, explanations, or UI instructions to customer-facing answer**\n- Set `<approved_answer>false</approved_answer>`\n- In agent context, provide the closest available answer following the same hierarchy (FAQ → Policy → Combined)\n\n## PRIMARY RULES\n\n### 1. Contact Instructions\n- **KEEP** contact instructions ONLY if they come from approved FAQ answers\n- **REMOVE** all other contact instructions, especially to GPs, clinics, or non-Level Health contacts\n- **NEVER ADD** contact instructions not present in the original source\n\n### 2. CRITICAL - No Document Type Substitution\n**STRICTLY FORBIDDEN:**\n- **NEVER substitute document types**: \"policy documents\" ≠ \"prescription letters\" ≠ \"sick certificates\" ≠ \"medical reports\"\n- **NEVER assume storage location**: Just because policy documents are in \"My Documents\" does NOT mean prescriptions, sick notes, or other documents are there\n- **NEVER assume functionality**: Just because something can be \"issued\" does NOT mean it can be \"accessed,\" \"downloaded,\" or \"viewed\" anywhere\n\n### 3. No Fabrication or Invention\n**STRICTLY FORBIDDEN:**\n- **NEVER invent policy terms**: \"changes effective from next renewal date\" unless explicitly stated\n- **NEVER invent coverage details**: dental coverage, visit limits, amounts unless explicitly documented\n- **NEVER invent functionality**: upload capabilities, platform features unless explicitly documented\n- **NEVER invent procedural information**: claim processes, requirements unless explicitly documented\n\n### 4. Verbatim Requirements for Approved Answers\n**`<approved_answer>true</approved_answer>` ONLY when:**\n- Customer-facing answer is 100% word-for-word identical to FAQ answer\n- No prepending (adding text before)\n- No appending (adding text after)\n- No modifications, substitutions, or paraphrasing of any kind\n- If even a single word is added, changed, or removed: `<approved_answer>false</approved_answer>`\n\n### 5. Logical Consistency Check\n**Before providing any answer, verify logical consistency:**\n- **WRONG**: \"For Plan B without D2D benefits, you can remove D2D benefits\" (impossible)\n- **RIGHT**: Check that the plan variant and suggested action are logically possible\n- **If unsure about logic**: Use \"no information available\" response\n\n## Customer-Facing Answer Guidelines\n\n### When Answer IS Available:\n- **Quote Verbatim**: Use exact phrases from source documents\n- **Complete Information**: Include all relevant details from the source\n- **No Additions**: Do not add contextual information not in the source\n- **Plan Specificity**: Always specify which plan variant you're referencing\n- **Logical Consistency**: Ensure the answer makes logical sense\n\n### When Answer is NOT Available:\n- **Only Say**: \"There is no information in the supported documentation to directly answer this question.\"\n- **No Additional Text**: Do not explain why there's no answer\n- **No UI Instructions**: Keep \"click Edit\" instructions in agent context only\n- **No Partial Information**: Do not provide related but incomplete information\n\n## Agent Context Guidelines\n\n### When Answer IS Available:\n- Provide additional relevant context from policy documents\n- Explain which sources were used and why (especially for combined answers)\n- Include related information that might help with follow-ups\n- Always specify plan variants and any assumptions made\n- Flag any potential logical inconsistencies\n\n### When Answer is NOT Available:\n- **Provide Closest Answer**: Find the next closest answer using the same hierarchy (FAQ → Policy → Combined)\n- **Explain the Gap**: What was searched for and why no exact answer exists\n- **Be Specific About Missing Information**: Clearly state what type of information is missing\n- **List Related Information**: What information IS available that might be relevant\n- **Include UI Instruction**: \"If you can provide an answer to this question, click 'Edit' to add an approved answer to the system\"\n\n## Source Document Guidelines\n\n### List Only Documents That Directly Contributed:\n- For available answers: Documents used in customer-facing answer\n- For unavailable answers: Documents used for closest answer in agent context\n- Combine references from same document: \"WR1124_Level Health Policy Document.pdf pages 5 and 17\"\n- Be concise: Don't list every document consulted, only those directly quoted\n\n## Before Providing Any Answer - MANDATORY CHECKLIST:\n\n1. **Am I following the exact response format with all required tags?**\n2. **Does the documentation explicitly contain every piece of information in my answer?**\n3. **If using approved_answer=true, is my answer 100% verbatim from the FAQ with zero modifications?**\n4. **Have I invented or fabricated ANY information not explicitly in the documents?**\n5. **If contact instructions exist, are they from an approved FAQ?**\n6. **Am I making any assumptions about functionality not explicitly documented?**\n7. **For plan questions, have I clearly stated which plan variant I'm referencing?**\n8. **Am I substituting any document types or assuming storage locations?**\n9. **Does my answer make logical sense (no contradictions like removing non-existent features)?**\n10. **If no exact answer exists, am I using ONLY the standard \"no information\" response?**\n\n**If ANY answer is \"no\" or \"unsure,\" you MUST provide the \"no information available\" response.**\n\n## Example Responses\n\n### Example 1: Exact FAQ Match Available\n```\n<question>How do I renew my policy?</question>\n\n<customer_facing_answer>You will receive your renewal invite via email approximately 30 days before your Renewal Date\nIf your policy is set up on Direct Debit and you don't need to do anything as your policy will automatically renew unless you contact us to make changes.\nPlease note that we can only discuss the policy and cover details with the policy holder and can make changes at their request or a third party who has the relevant permissions granted by the Policy holder and noted on the policy.\nIf you pay by card annually you will need to log into the Customer Portal and make a payment.</customer_facing_answer>\n\n<agent_context>The customer's question is directly addressed by the FAQ on page 33 of the FAQs.pdf document. The answer provided is comprehensive and covers all necessary steps for policy renewal, including automatic renewal for Direct Debit and manual renewal for card payments. Ensure the customer understands the timeline for receiving the renewal invite and the actions required based on their payment method.</agent_context>\n\n<source_documents>\n- FAQs.pdf page 33\n</source_documents>\n\n<approved_answer>true</approved_answer>\n\n<matched_question>How do I renew my policy?</matched_question>\n```\n\n### Example 2: No Information Available\n```\n<question>Where can I get a copy of my sick certificate provided by an online GP consultation for social welfare and employer purposes?</question>\n\n<customer_facing_answer>There is no information in the supported documentation to directly answer this question.</customer_facing_answer>\n\n<agent_context>The customer is asking about accessing a sick certificate from an online GP consultation. The documentation confirms that doctors can issue sick notes if medically necessary (FAQs page 54), and that policy documents can be accessed in the \"My Documents\" section of the customer portal (FAQs page 5). However, there is no explicit information about where sick certificates are stored or how customers can access them after they've been issued. The closest available information is about accessing policy documents, but this does not cover medical certificates or documents issued during consultations. If you can provide an answer to this question, click 'Edit' to add an approved answer to the system.</agent_context>\n\n<source_documents>\n- FAQs.pdf page 54\n- FAQs.pdf page 5\n</source_documents>\n\n<approved_answer>false</approved_answer>\n```\n\n### Example 3: Fabrication Errors - NEVER DO THIS\n```\nNEVER DO THIS - Hallucinated Information:\n<customer_facing_answer>For Plan C, dental visits are covered at €30 per visit for routine treatment, with 6 visits per annum.</customer_facing_answer>\n(This information was not in the source documents)\n\nNEVER DO THIS - Added Text to FAQ:\n<customer_facing_answer>No, you do not need separate travel insurance. Free travel insurance is included in all Level Health plans...</customer_facing_answer>\n<approved_answer>true</approved_answer>\n(Added \"No, you do not need separate travel insurance\" to the FAQ answer)\n\nNEVER DO THIS - Invented Functionality:\n<customer_facing_answer>You can upload these documents using the Level Health app or website.</customer_facing_answer>\n(Upload functionality not documented)\n\nCORRECT APPROACH FOR ALL ABOVE:\n<customer_facing_answer>There is no information in the supported documentation to directly answer this question.</customer_facing_answer>\n<approved_answer>false</approved_answer>\n```\n\n## Final Reminder\n\n**ACCURACY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN BEING HELPFUL.** It is better to disappoint a customer with \"no information available\" than to provide incorrect, fabricated, or assumed information. Your role is to be a reliable source of documented information, not to be helpful at the expense of accuracy."

    "content": "The customer asked the following question:\n\nDo any of plan A, B, C, or D cover the beacon hospital?\n\nWe have multiple distinct sources of information that may contain the answer:\n\n1. We have a list of frequently asked questions (FAQs) that may contain the answer:\n\n- Document: FAQs.pdf\n- Page: 157\n- Question:\nwhat plan do I need to go go the beacon hospital\n\n- Answer:\nYou can go to the Beacon Hospital with Plan B, Plan C, or Plan D. Plan A does not cover this hospital.\n\n- Document: FAQs.pdf\n- Page: 195\n- Question:\nWhat plan do I need to go to high tech hospitals? Can I do that with plan C?\n\n- Answer:\nPlan C covers high-tech hospitals like Blackrock Clinic and Mater Private Dublin. But subject to excess and co payment as per your policy. DMCG - test\n\n- Document: FAQs.pdf\n- Page: 214\n- Question:\nWhat information is available about Plan A?\n\n- Answer:\nFor Plan A, you are covered for visits to Loughlinstown A&amp;E under Level Health Plan A. As a public hospital A&amp;E, you're eligible for up to €100 per visit. This coverage is not subject to the out-patient excess, meaning you can claim this benefit regardless of whether you've met your annual out-patient excess or not. Additionally, Plan A provides full cover for day cases and semi-private rooms in public hospitals, and covers private rooms at the semi-private rate. Consultants' fees are fully covered for participating consultants. Psychiatric treatment is covered up to 100 days per calendar year in public hospitals only. Drug, alcohol, gambling, and substance abuse treatment is covered up to 91 days every 5 years in public facilities only. Convalescence care is covered at €26 per day for up to 14 days. Maternity benefits include up to €400 per claim for in-patient hospital delivery and in-patient maternity consultant fees.\n\n- Document: FAQs.pdf\n- Page: 41\n- Question:\nWhat kind of hospital accommodation will I get with my policy?\n\n- Answer:\nThe hospital accomodation you may get, depends on the level of cover provided under your plan and it is subject to availability in the hospital at the time of admission. You should always check your level of cover before receiving treatment and before being admitted in a hospital to check if the hospital is approved on your plan and if your plan covers you at the semi-private room rate only and if so, you should advise the hospital. You must pay any excess, shortfall and/or co-payment that may apply on your plan depending on your level of cover and you cannot claim these expenses back from your Insurer. All cover is subject to the policy terms and conditions and dependent on the member having all waiting period served.\n\n- Document: FAQs.pdf\n- Page: 216\n- Question:\nCan you send me full details for plan B.\n\n- Answer:\nFor Plan B with a €300 excess (without Day-to-Day benefits), your hospital cover includes:\n- Public Hospitals:\n  - Day case: Full cover\n  - Semi-private room: Full cover\n  - Private room: Covered at semi-private rate\n- Private Hospitals:\n  - Day case: Covered with a €150 excess per claim\n  - Semi-private room: Covered with a €300 excess per admission\n  - Private room: Covered at semi-private rate with €300 excess per admission\n- Specified Orthopaedic Procedures: Co-payment of €2,000 (in addition to excess)\n- Specified Ophthalmic Procedures: Co-payment of €400 (in addition to excess)\nNote: Coverage may differ for Plan B with different excess amounts or with Day-to-Day benefits.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.

These expenses can include hospital car park charges, transportation to and from the hospital (such as taxis and public transport), hotel accommodation for one night before or after treatment as a day case patient. We may also cover other related treatments that are not otherwise listed. You can claim this benefit by submitting receipts that include the date of payment for the related expense. The maximum amount that can be claimed in a policy year is on the Table of Cover. This benefit is subject to the waiting periods that apply to hospital cover.\n\n- Document: WR1124_Level Health Policy Document.pdf\n- Page: 9\n- Content:\n## In-Patient & Day Case Scans\n\nMRI, CT, PET-CT, Dexa, Ultrasound, Mammogram and other scans are covered if they are carried out while you are receiving in-patient or day case treatment which is covered under your plan.\n\n- Document: WR1124_Level Health Policy Document.pdf\n- Page: 9\n- Content:\n## Consultants' and Other Professionals' Fees\n\nIn most cases treatment or procedures in hospitals will be carried out by your medical consultant but there are some treatments and procedures listed in the Schedule of Benefits which can be performed by another health care professional including your GP, dentist, oral surgeon or periodontist.\n\nIn most cases, for a procedure or treatment that is listed in the Schedule of Benefits and carried out in a setting where you are covered, the full amount of your health care professionals' fees will be covered. We fully cover health care professionals who are registered with us and have agreed to accept payment from us in full settlement of their professional fees (i.e. a participating health care professional). If the healthcare professional is registered with us but does not accept payment from us in full settlement of their professional fees (i.e. a part-participating health care professional), you will have to pay some of the health care professional's fees yourself. If the healthcare provider is not registered with us or is not participating, you will have to pay all of the health care provider's professional's fees yourself.\n\nThe Schedule of Benefits provides details of the various surgical and diagnostic procedures and medical illnesses that you are covered for under your plan. It also explains the amount that we will pay for treatment provided by a consultant or other health care professional. Certain procedure codes listed in the Schedule of Benefits have conditions of payment such as necessary clinical indications.\n\n- Document: WR1124_TOC-B150-D2D.pdf\n- Page: 1\n- Content:\nHospital Cover - Other Benefits\n\n| Consultants' fees | Full cover for participating consultants |\n| :-- | :-- |\n| Psychiatric treatment | Covered up to 100 days per calendar year (with any insurer), subject to excess |\n| Drug, alcohol, gambling & substance abuse | Covered up to 91 days every 5 years (with any insurer), subject to excess |\n| Convalescence care | €26 per day for up to 14 days |\n\n- Document: WR1124_TOC-B300.pdf\n- Page: 1\n- Content:\n# Table of Cover - Level Health Plan B (with €300 Excess) \n\nYour Hospital Cover\n\n| Public Hospitals |  |\n| :-- | :-- |\n| Day case | Full cover |\n| Semi-private room | Full cover |\n| Private room | Covered at semi-private rate |\n| Private Hospitals |  |\n| Day case | Covered with a $€ 150$ excess per claim |\n| Semi-private room | Covered with a $€ 300$ excess per admission |\n| Private room | Covered at semi-private rate with $€ 300$ excess per admission |\n| Specified Orthopaedic Procedures | Co-payment of $€ 2,000$ (in addition to excess) |\n| Specified Ophthalmic Procedures | Co-payment of $€ 400$ (in addition to excess) |\n\n- Document: WR1124_TOC-B500.pdf\n- Page: 1\n- Content:\n# Table of Cover - Level Health Plan B (with $€ 500$ Excess)\n\nYour Hospital Cover\n\n| Public Hospitals |  |\n| :-- | :-- |\n| Day case | Full cover |\n| Semi-private room | Full cover |\n| Private room | Covered at semi-private rate |\n| Private Hospitals |  |\n| Day case | Covered with a $€ 200$ excess per claim |\n| Semi-private room | Covered with a $€ 500$ excess per admission |\n| Private room | Covered at semi-private rate with $€ 500$ excess per admission |\n| Specified Orthopaedic Procedures | Co-payment of $€ 2,000$ (in addition to excess) |\n| Specified Ophthalmic Procedures | Co-payment of $€ 400$ (in addition to excess) |\n\n- Document: WR1124_TOC-B150-D2D.pdf\n- Page: 1\n- Content:\nAll benefits are per policy year unless otherwise stated.
